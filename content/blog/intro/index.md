### About Dave...
I'm Dave Cuddihy. I live in Ithaca, NY. My wife, daughter, and I moved
here from Brooklyn during the summer of 2020 -- partly in response to
difficulties and generally scariness that was COVID in New York City spring 2020,
but more in response to the fact that we were enjoying New York less and less.

I don't have any extravagant hobbies. When I come upon free time,
I usually spend it trying to figure something out.  For example,
I'm really enjoying trying to follow
[Leonard Susskind's Physics lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PL6i60qoDQhQGaGbbg-4aSwXJvxOqO6o5e).

#### Professionally
I'm a hands-on developer. My primary language has been Python for the last 13 years.
Before that I was working mostly in C++ and Java.

I'm a technical leader. I've lead software engineering teams for more
than 25 years. I've also served
as the CTO for a $6B hedge fund.

I currently teach a class about Natural Language Processing For Finance
as part of the Masters in Financial Engineering program at Baruch College, CUNY.

[My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cuddihy-5014419/)


I have a background in math and quantitative finance, including an
[MFE from Baruch](https://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/), and a
BS in Applied Math from [New Mexico Tech](https://www.nmt.edu/).

Prior to working in finance, I've worked on various projects including
speech systems, a system to recognize music, and -- going back to the start of
my career -- quantitative biology tools at
[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/).


### ...So, why the blog?
I wanted to create a blog focused on my professional interests for a couple of
reasons:

1. **CVs don't really cut it anymore.**  If you want to collaborate with
    me, I bet you're going to want to get a better sense of what sorts of problems
    interest me and how I might go about solving them.
1. **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)**
     I'd rather point you to a piece of writing that explains my thoughts on
     something than have to reinvent it every time.
1. **Practice.** This provides me with an opportunity to be a
     better communicator.

...I'm sure this list will grow.



*PS: Yes. This is just the
   [gastby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)!
  ...which give me opportunity to practice my ReactJS. ..and it puts me in
  [good company!](https://overreacted.io/)*
