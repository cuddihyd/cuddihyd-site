### About Dave...
I'm David Cuddihy. I live in Ithaca, NY. We moved up here from Brooklyn the
summer of 2020.

I currently work remotely for a hedge fund in Europe heading up their
data-engineering efforts.  

I somtimes teach:
I'll be teaching a class for the Baruch MFE Fall 2021: NLP For Finance.

I also help out on interesting projects: I'm helping my friend Adam Hocek
at [Aecho](https://www.aecho.ai/) apply ML to the analysis of emotional
content in human speech.

I'm a hands-on. My primary language has been Python for the last 13 years.
Before that I was working mostly in C++ and Java.

I have a background in math and quantitative finance, including an
[MFE from Baruch](https://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/), and a
BS in Applied Math from [New Mexico Tech](https://www.nmt.edu/).

I've worked in other fun fields as well including speech systems,
music recognition, and quantitative biology at
[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/)
where I started my career.


### ...So, why the blog?
I wanted to create a blog focused on my professional interests for a couple of
reasons:

1. **CVs don't really cut it anymore.**  If you want to collaborate with
  me, I bet you're going to want to get a better sense of what sorts of problems
   interest me and how I might go about solving them.

2. **Practice.** Communicating ideas is hard. This gives me opportunity to
  get better.

...I'm sure this list will grow.



*PS: Yes. This is just the
   [gastby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)!
  This'll give me opportunity to practice my ReactJS. ..and it puts me in
  [good company!](https://overreacted.io/)*
